# Contact Sheet Script

This is a script for creating contact sheets in GIMP 2.10. It is an updated and patched version of the official script on the GIMP GitLab site.

This script does not currently work on Windows due to problems with the interpreter. 

This script is still under development.

## Installation

To install the script, download it and then drag and drop it into your scripts folder. The scripts folder is located in Edit > Preferences > Folders.
Usage

To use the script, open GIMP and go to File > Create > Contact Sheet. The script will open a dialog box where you can specify the options for your contact sheet.

The following options and more are available:

    Source Images: This is the folder that contains the images you want to include in your contact sheet.
    Size: This option allows you to customize or choose from a range of sizes for the contact sheet.
    Rows: This is the number of rows of images you want in your contact sheet.
    Columns: This is the number of columns of images you want in your contact sheet.
    Spacing: This is the amount of space between the images in your contact sheet.
    Rotate: This allows the iamges to be flipped horizontally to fit better on your contact sheet.
    
Once you have specified the options, click OK to create your contact sheet.
