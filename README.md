# GIMP Image Caption Plugin
This is an easy to use GIMP plugin to add captions to image thumbnails. 

## Description
This plugin allows you to add a caption text to an image in a grid, much like a contact sheet in the darkroom. Currerntly only for 2.10, but I will be shortly workign a new version for the next version gimp.

## Building and Installation
This plugin is written in C using GIMP Plugin SDK.


To build:

cd into contactsheet, them modify the Makefile to point to your GIMP's plugin folder. 


Then simply write make into the terminal. 


This will change to be more user freindly.


Restart GIMP and the plugin will show up under File->Create.

## Todo
Develop for next version of GIMP\
Make installation easier.
